Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI - Submission
Project Overview:

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for managing users, roles, and permissions within an admin dashboard. The dashboard allows administrators to efficiently handle user management, role assignments, and permissions, providing a secure and intuitive UI for role-based access control.

Technologies Used:

Frontend Framework: Next.js
TypeScript: Type-safe development to ensure robustness and scalability.
UI Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern design and layout.
Animations: Framer Motion for smooth, interactive animations.
Core Features:

User Management:

Ability to view and manage users.
Options to add, edit, or delete users.
Features to assign roles to users and toggle their account status (Active/Inactive).
Role Management:

Interface for defining and editing user roles.
Customizable roles with the ability to include specific permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete.
Dynamic Permissions Management:

Role-based permissions can be assigned or modified.
Clear and intuitive display of available permissions for each role, making modifications straightforward.
API Simulations (Optional):

Mocked API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles, simulating server interactions for validation.
Design Approach:

Responsiveness: Ensures seamless experience across all devices, adapting the layout for mobile and desktop views using Tailwind CSS.
User Experience (UX): Clean and intuitive interface, focusing on ease of use for administrators managing users and roles.
Security: Basic input validation and error handling for secure operations.
Challenges and Learning:

While implementing the features, I focused on improving my understanding of TypeScript. Some advanced features were planned but had to be postponed due to time constraints. However, the project still demonstrates core RBAC functionalities effectively.

Conclusion: This project highlights the functionality of an RBAC system, with a clean and modern design. The use of Next.js and TypeScript provides a solid foundation for the application's scalability, while Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive design. The application is built to handle user and role management efficiently and securely, with smooth interactions powered by Framer Motion.
